# Chat-Application
Web application developed with the help of React and Node.js for my bachelor's degree thesis. 
Use the "npm run dev" command in the terminal in both backend and frontend folders in order to run the app. 
Also make sure to install the "node_modules" folder in both backend and frontend.
